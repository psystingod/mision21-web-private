When we talk about revolution, we always imagine the great civil wars started by the people against the military, or we imagine young people demonstrating in the streets against the system. But I want us to think of revolution as a new way of thinking, a fascinating idea, or a new path forward that challenges the status quo.

Bitcoin is a topic that isn't easy for everyone to grasp because it was introduced in our country through the central government, and from that point on, it became a polarizing issue.

But when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the famous Bitcoin white paper, he wasn't thinking about giving power to politicians, but to the people. And that's where Bitcoin education begins to shape people who passionately start a revolution in the use and promotion of Bitcoin because they identify Bitcoin as a form of economic protest that is more effective than a march of fanatics shouting about the abuses of the banks.

My view has always been that Bitcoin was a deadly invention, a way for the government and other powerful people to plunder the country and sell the idea of ​​a digital currency they could create whenever they wanted, thus becoming millionaires because it would be legal in our country. What a misguided idea! I was right, but I was pointing in the wrong direction. That's what the Federal Reserve does with dollars: create and create until they feel like it, causing even more inflation in countries like ours.

Bitcoin is decentralized, censorship-resistant, limited, transparent, and inclusive. And I learned all of this by educating myself on the subject. I went from being a student in the My First Bitcoin El Salvador diploma program to becoming one of its instructors nationwide, and I was able to work closely with incredible organizations like Bitcoin Beach El Salvador, Blink, and Tiankii. I continue to be involved with these projects in some way, which also allow me to lead my own project called Bitcoin Oriente and the Mission 21 Foundation.

The philosophy of Bitcoin demands that before thinking about money, we think about our people and how they think about money. That's why my intention in sharing this topic with you is to encourage you to study Bitcoin and how it represents a true revolution.
